# Instacart-python-analysis
# Project Objective

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of Instacart’s online grocery sales data to identify purchasing patterns and customer segments. The analysis supports the development of targeted marketing strategies by examining when customers shop, how much they spend, and how ordering behavior differs across customer profiles.

# Business Context

Instacart stakeholders aim to improve advertising effectiveness and product positioning by understanding customer diversity and behavior. Rather than applying a one-size-fits-all approach, this analysis helps distinguish meaningful customer segments based on loyalty, region, and demographics.

# Tools & Technologies

Python (pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy, os)

Jupyter Notebook

Anaconda environment

# Analysis Overview

The project includes:

Importing and cleaning multiple open-source Instacart datasets

Merging order, product, and customer data into a single analytical dataset

Conducting descriptive and statistical checks throughout the workflow

Creating derived variables such as price ranges, loyalty categories, and regional segments

Exploring customer behavior through aggregation and visualization

# Key Insights

Order volumes vary by day of the week and hour of the day, highlighting optimal and low-traffic windows for advertising.

Higher spending tends to occur during specific times of day, suggesting opportunities for premium product promotions.

Simplified price groupings help distinguish purchasing patterns across customer types.

Product demand differs significantly across departments.

Customer behavior varies by loyalty status, region, and demographic characteristics, supporting the need for targeted marketing.
Ethical Considerations

Customer data was handled with care, avoiding the use of personally identifiable information and focusing on aggregated insights only.

# Outcome

This project demonstrates practical skills in data wrangling, exploratory analysis, customer segmentation, and data visualization, delivering insights that can inform marketing and sales strategy decisions.

# Data Source

The Instacart Online Grocery Shopping Dataset 2017, accessed via Kaggle (February 2025).
